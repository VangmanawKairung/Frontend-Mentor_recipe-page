## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (Sassy CSS)
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design Techniques
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts
- Accessibility Best Practices

### What I learned

This challenge improved my skills in writing semantic HTML5 and crafting accessible designs using ARIA attributes. I learned to use SCSS for cleaner, scalable styles with variables, nesting, and a mobile-first workflow. Applying Flexbox and CSS Grid allowed me to create a responsive, well-structured layout.

This SCSS snippet showcases my use of variables, nesting, and custom styles for the preparation section:

```
.prepare-info {
  background-color: $prepare-section-background-color;
  padding: 25px;
  border-radius: 10px;

  h3 {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    color: $prepare-section-heading-and-bullet-color;
  }

  ul li::marker {
    color: $prepare-section-heading-and-bullet-color;
    font-weight: $bold-text-font-weight;
  }
}

```

Iâ€™m proud of how this code is organized, reusable, and visually consistent. This project strengthened my skills in building clean, responsive, and accessible web pages.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills by exploring more advanced concepts like animations, transitions, and responsive typography. For future projects, I want to deepen my understanding of accessibility standards, experiment with modern tools like CSS variables alongside SCSS, and integrate JavaScript to add interactivity. Each challenge is an opportunity to refine my workflow and create better, more user-friendly web experiences.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_list.asp) - This website demonstrates how to style the list basically.
- [::marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This page shows how to assess the list marker by using psuedo element `marker`.
