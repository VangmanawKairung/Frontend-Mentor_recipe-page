      <ol>
        <li>
          Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
          You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
          Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
          the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
      </ul>
